Intoduction
```````````

This plugin control a RoperScientific/Princeton camera under windows and linux, using the PVCAM (Photometrics Virtual Camera Access Method) libraries.

It is in production at SOLEIL under windows and it has been tested at Desy under linux .
Model used at SOLEIL: PI-MTE:2048B

Prerequisite
````````````
The RoperScientific is connected to a specific computer with a PCI board
the Lima/RoperScientific client has to Run on this PC

Initialisation and Capabilities
````````````````````````````````
In order to help people to understand how the camera plugin has been implemented in LImA this section
provide some important information about the developer's choices.

Camera initialisation
......................
- The camera will be initialized within the RoperScientificCamera object. One should pass to the RoperScientificCamera constructor, the Camera number as an int.
for exemple : 0

Std capabilites
................

This plugin has been implemented in respect of the mandatory capabilites but with some limitations according 
to some programmer's  choices.  We only provide here extra information for a better understanding
of the capabilities for the RoperScientific camera.

* HwDetInfo

 - Max image size is : 2048 * 2048
 - 16 bit unsigned type is supported

* HwSync

  trigger type supported are:
	- IntTrig
	- ExtTrigSingle
	- ExtTrigMult
	- ExtGate
  
  
Optional capabilites
........................

* HwBin
	- all values are accepted
	
* HwRoi



Configuration
`````````````

No Specific hardware configuration are needed

How to use
````````````
here is the list of accessible fonctions to configure and use the RoperScientific detector:

.. code-block:: cpp

	void setGain(long);
	long getGain();

	void setFullFrame(rgn_type* roi);
	void setBinRoiParameters(rgn_type* roi);

	void setSpeedTableIndex(unsigned);
	unsigned getSpeedTableIndex(void);
	const std::string& getADCRate(void);

	double 	getTemperature();
	double 	getTemperatureSetPoint();
	void	setTemperatureSetPoint(double temperature);
